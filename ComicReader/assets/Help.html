    <h2>Favorite comics</h2>
    The main page displayed when the app starts is the place where you'll find all your favorite comics. Each row contains
    3 buttons which provide you with 3 alternate choices of browsing that comic. Each of them will be described in detail below.
    <h3>Latest</h3>
    This will take you to the latest comic-strip for that comic
    <h3>Pre</h3>
    This will take you straight to where you left off when the last time you read that comic. This is a very useful feature
    especially when you visit back to the comic after a long time. You don't have to remember where you left off. Our app does
    that for you!
    <h3>Fav</h3>
    This can be used to browse all those strips which you had marked as favorite, for that comic.
    <p>
    You can store your favorite comic list and restore them back later (while you are busy experimenting with new comics!), by
    doing the following from the main screen: Menu -> 'Backup my list'  and  Menu -> 'Restore my list'.
    For an exhaustive list of features, just browse through the list which opens when you press menu button while in the main-screen
    </p>

    <h2>Selecting your favorite comics:</h2>
    You can select your favorite comics by doing the following from the main-screen: Menu -> Select Comic.
    This will open a list of all comics currently supported by this app. BTW, the list is still growing!
    If you aren't sure whether you like a comic by its name, then you can try our new feature called 'preview'.
    This will open the comic which you can browse, read some strips and then decide whether you like this comic or not.
    Cool! isn't it?
    In order to save your favorite list, just press the 'Save Changes', else press 'Cancel', both at the top of the list.
    You can also select all/none of the comics by pressing Menu -> 'Select All' or 'Select None' respectively.
    Last but not the least, if you have any cool comic series in mind, shoot a request at us by: Menu -> Comic Request.
    In case you want to visit the actual website where this comic is hosted on, just long press on the comic name.
